# GH D3D11 Test Environment

Nothing crazy in here, just a couple of test environments for you to practice hooking on.

The D3D11 project makes use of the DXSDK_DIR macro, so if you don't have that set up you may run into errors.  One quick little work around is to just add a new entry to your PATH variable with the name DXSDK_DIR and the value being the path (including trailing '\') to the sdk on disk.
