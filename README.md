D3D11 Test Environment
======================

This repository contains two dedicated Direct3D 11 test environments developed in C++. These environments are designed to provide a platform for beginner hack programmers to practice function hooking and other techniques using the DirectX API, a popular Windows graphics API for drawing 3-dimensional objects. The goal here is to enable learning and experimentation without the risk of penalties associated with live game testing, such as kicks and bans.

The Direct3D 11 test environment creates a window, initializes DX, and enters the main loop where messages are processed, requiring more null pointers declarations and usage of the DirectX namespace compared to D3D9. While the Direct3D 11 environment may be more complex, it provides an excellent opportunity to deepen your understanding of DirectX's intricacies.

Please note that the D3D9 project relies on the DXSDK_DIR macro. If you encounter any issues, try adding a new entry to your PATH variable with the name DXSDK_DIR, and the value being the path to the SDK on disk (don't forget the trailing '\').

Feel free to use these environments as your sandbox for practicing and experimenting. Happy Coding!

It's a simple, yet powerful, D3D11 application that serves as a test environment for various D3D11 techniques and experiments.

Background
----------

DirectX 11, or D3D11, is a graphics API that's widely used in game development. It provides a low-level interface to the graphics hardware, allowing developers to leverage the power of the GPU for rendering complex 3D scenes and effects. This repository provides a simple D3D11 application that can be used as a starting point for learning about D3D11 and game hacking.

Getting Started with D3D11
---------------

To get started with this repository, you'll need a basic understanding of C++ and Windows programming. Familiarity with graphics programming and DirectX is a plus, but not strictly necessary. The code is written in a straightforward manner, and I've tried to comment it as much as possible to make it easy to understand.

You'll need Visual Studio to build and run the project. Simply open the `TestEnvironmentD3D11.sln` file in Visual Studio, build the solution, and run the project.

Direct3D11 Test Environment Overview
-------------

The main entry point for the application is in `WinMain.cpp`. This file contains the `WinMain` function, which is the entry point for Windows applications. It creates a window, initializes D3D11, and enters the main message loop.

The `InitD3D` function is responsible for initializing D3D11. It creates a D3D11 device and a swap chain, sets up a render target, and initializes the necessary resources for text rendering.

The `Render` function is called every frame to render the scene. It clears the render target, draws some text, and presents the back buffer to the screen.

The `NativeWindow` class, defined in `NativeWindow.h` and implemented in `NativeWindow.cpp`, is a simple wrapper around a Win32 window. It handles window creation and message processing.

FAQ
---

##### What is DirectX?
DirectX is a collection of APIs for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms.

##### What is a swap chain?
A swap chain is a collection of back buffers that are used for rendering. The rendered image is presented to the screen by swapping the back buffer with the front buffer.

##### What is a render target?

A render target is a resource that can be rendered to. In this case, it's a 2D texture that's used as the back buffer for the swap chain.

##### What is a D3D11 device?

A D3D11 device is an object that represents the graphics hardware. It's used to create resources, such as textures and buffers, and to execute commands on the GPU.

##### What is the purpose of this repository?

This repository serves as a test environment for learning and experimenting with D3D11 and game hacking techniques. It's a simple D3D11 application that can be easily modified and extended.

##### What is the experience level required to use this source code?

A basic understanding of C++ and Windows programming is required. Familiarity with graphics programming and DirectX is a plus, but not strictly necessary. The code is written in a straightforward manner, and I've tried to comment it as much as possible to make it easy to understand.
